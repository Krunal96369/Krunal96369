### 📈 Featured Projects

#### 🕵️‍♂️ Fraud Detection System Using Isolation Forest  
**[🔗 View Project](https://github.com/Krunal96369/fraud_detection)** 
🗓️ May 2025  
Developed an automated fraud detection system using the Isolation Forest algorithm from the PyOD library to identify financial transaction anomalies **without labeled data**.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time anomaly detection  
- Fully unsupervised model with configurable contamination rate  
- Visual analytics comparing normal vs. anomalous transactions  
- Histogram-based insights into transaction behavior  

**Tech Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PyOD, Jupyter Notebook  
**Impact:** Improved early fraud detection and reduced manual review workload.
