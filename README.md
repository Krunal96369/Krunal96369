# 👋 Hey, I'm Krunal Chauhan

### 🚀 Software Engineer (Data/Platform) • Real-time Systems • Cloud-Native

I design and ship reliable systems: data pipelines, streaming services,
and APIs that turn messy inputs into clean, fast, observable products.
3+ years in the trenches, currently finishing a Master’s in Software
Engineering @ UHCL. I care about smart abstractions, tests that matter,
and shipping code that’s easy to run at 3 a.m.

- 🔭 Building: event-driven backends, real-time analytics, resilient pipelines  
- 🧪 Loop: model → automate → deploy → measure  
- ☁️ Clouds: **AWS** (S3, EMR, Glue, Lambda, Redshift), **GCP**  
- 📍 Houston-ish • Remote-friendly

## 📈 Featured Projects

### 🕵️‍♂️ Fraud Detection — Isolation Forest (Unsupervised)
**Repo:** [`fraud_detection`](https://github.com/Krunal96369/fraud_detection)  
**When:** May 2025

Automated anomaly detection pipeline using Isolation Forest (PyOD) for
financial transactions — no labels needed.

- Real-time scoring with configurable contamination rate  
- Visual analytics: normal vs. anomalous distributions  
- Clean notebooks and reproducible environment

**Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PyOD, Jupyter

---

### 🧠 ThinkDocs.ai — AI Document Intelligence (RAG)
Production Q&A over unstructured PDFs with low-latency retrieval,
stable ingestion, and observability.

- Sub-200ms answers, doc auto-ingest, dashboards and metrics  
**Stack:** FastAPI, ChromaDB, Prometheus, Grafana

---

### 🏀 NBA Analytics Pipeline
ETL → normalized DB → executive dashboards. Computes PER, TS%, and
Four Factors with rate-limits and retries.

**Stack:** Python, SQL, Power BI

---

### 🏥 Clinic Ops Platform
Full-stack patient management with RBAC/JWT and real-time alerts.
Reduced scheduling time by ~45%.

**Stack:** React, Node, Postgres, Socket.io, AWS SNS

---

### 🎓 Advising Data Warehouse (UHCL)
Automations across Google Sheets/CRM. Standardized inputs led to ~30%
fewer errors and ~40% faster updates.

---

### 💳 Pay + Maps SDK
React + MUI front ends integrating Stripe/Razorpay and Google Maps.
Reporting scripts turned hours into minutes.

## 🧪 How I build

- **Event-first modeling:** design streams and schemas before code  
- **Contracts & tests:** JSON schema + smoke + contract tests  
- **Guardrails:** idempotent jobs, checkpoints, safe backfills  
- **Observability:** metrics over vibes; useful dashboards and alerts

---

## 📚 Currently learning

- Event-driven system design (sagas, outbox, backpressure)  
- Cost-aware modeling on Redshift / column stores  
- Better DX for dbt + Airflow in mono-repos
