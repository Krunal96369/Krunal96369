# 👋 Hey, I'm Krunal Chauhan

### Backend Engineer • Real-time Infrastructure • Scalable Systems

I build backend systems that handle production load: real-time messaging
infrastructure with 10K+ concurrent connections, APIs serving 500K+ daily
requests, and async pipelines processing thousands of background jobs with
99% uptime. 3+ years shipping code that scales.

Currently finishing an MS in Software Engineering @ UHCL.

- 🔧 Recent: Real-time chat infrastructure, multi-tier Redis caching, WebSocket at scale
- ☁️ Clouds: AWS (EC2, Lambda, S3, CloudWatch), Docker, CI/CD
- 📍 Houston • Remote-ready
